This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## File Structure for Scenarios

To manage different scenarios, you can organize your project structure as follows:

```
/scenarios
  /scenario1
    - page.tsx
  /scenario2
    - page.tsx
  /scenario3
    - page.tsx
```

These scenarios are based on assorted HackerRank React challenges, providing practical examples and exercises to enhance your React skills.

To see the changes take effect, run the development server and the page will automatically populate the list of scenarios for you.

## Using and Swapping Between Scenarios

To use a specific scenario, you can select it from the dropdown menu on the main page after running the development server. Follow these steps:

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

3. On the main page, you will see a dropdown menu to select a scenario. Choose the desired scenario from the dropdown.

4. The page will automatically update to display the selected scenario.

This approach allows you to dynamically switch between different scenarios without modifying the code.
